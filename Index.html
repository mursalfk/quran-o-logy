                    <p style="margin-left: 100px;  margin-right: 100px; text-align: justify"> 
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The first thing to understand about the Quran is its form.  The Arabic word, ‘Quran,’ literally means both ‘recitation’ 
                        and ‘reading’. Similarly, the Quran was both recited orally and written down in book form.  The true power of the Quran 
                        remains in the oral recitation, as it is meant to be read aloud and melodiously, but still the verses were written down 
                        on available materials as an aid to memorizing and guarding it,  and these were collected and ordered in book form both 
                        privately and, at a later stage, institutionally. The Quran was not meant to tell a chronological story, and thus, the 
                        Quran should not be viewed as a sequential narrative like the book of Genesis.
                        The Arabic book that goes by the name Quran is about as long as the New Testament.In most editions it is about 600 pages 
                        in length. In contrast to the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, the Quran was issued from the mouth of a single person, 
                        who recited what he heard from the angel Gabriel.  On the other hand, both the Jewish and the Christian scriptures are 
                        collections of many books that were written down by a large number of human beings, and opinions differ as to their status 
                        as revelation.

                    <h2 style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; text-align: center ">How Is The Quran Organized?</h2>
                    <p style="margin-left: 100px; margin-right: 100px; text-align: justify">
                        &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Quran is composed of 114 parts or chapters of unequal length.  
                        Each chapter is called a surah in Arabic and each sentence or phrase of the Quran is called an aaya, 
                        literally ‘a sign.’  Like the Bible, the Quran is divided into discrete units, referred to as verses in English.
                        These verses are not standard in length or meter, and where each begins and ends was not decided by human beings,
                        but dictated by God.  Each one is a discrete act of locution of closed signification, or ‘sign’, denoted by the 
                        word aayah in Arabic.  The shortest of the surahs has ten words, and the longest surah, which is placed second 
                        in the text, has 6,100 words.  The first surah, the Fatihah ("The Opening"), is relatively short (twenty-five words).
                        From the second surah onward, the surahs gradually decrease in length, although this is not a hard and fast rule. 
                        The last sixty surahs take up about as much space as the second.  Some of the longer aayahs are much longer than 
                        the shortest surahs.  All surahs, except one, begin with Bisillah hir-Rahman nir-Rahim, ‘In the Name of God, the 
                        Most-Merciful, the Compassionate.’  Each surah has a name that usually mentions a key motto within it. 
                        For example, the longest surah, Surah al-Baqara, or "The Cow", is named after the story of Moses commanding the
                        Jews to offer a sacrifice of a cow, which begins by God saying:
                    </p>
                </p>
                <p style="text-align: center">
                    <b><i>"And remember when Moses said to his people: ‘God commands that you sacrifice a cow…’" (Quran 2:67)</i></b>
                </p>
